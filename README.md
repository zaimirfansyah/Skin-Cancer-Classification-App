# Dicoding: Belajar Penerapan Machine Learning pada Android Submission üì±

This is a repository that contains the source code of my submissions project at Dicoding's "Belajar Penerapan Machine Learning pada Android" course, starting from the first submission until the final submission. This course is a part of self-paced learning in the Bangkit 2024 Mobile Development learning path. I have tried to implement the best practices of the Kotlin programming language and the Android framework in this project.
